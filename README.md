# New York City: Citi Bike Analysis

### Overview

This project involves running an analysis of Citi Bike in New York City in order to explore the potential of recreating Citi Bike to Des Moines, Iowa. Python pandas library was use to clean up the data and Tableau was used for visualizations.

## Purpose

Visualizations used in this analysis are found on Tableau public [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/6JZWQJPQW?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Investors looking to recreate the bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa had the following questions. A Tableau story was built to make it easier to show the results of the analysis.

### Background information

    - How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
    - How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
    - A break down of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.


## Results
To start there were a total of 2,344,224 Citi Bike Trips with top starting locations being in high populated tourist attractions (One World, Manhattan, Empire State Building, Central Park)

Peak hours seem to range from 7 AM to 9 PM, with 5-6 PM being the most popular. The average trip duraction was 20 minutes or less (visual shown in "Checkout Times for Users"). It was interesting to see that Males had more trips done that Females (15 - 40 min). 

The square heat map shows that many trips are done 6-10 AM (M-F) while weekends are scattered between 9-7 PM. Males can also be seen taking more trips during those hours than Females. There are defintely a higher number of trips during the workweek ("User Trips by Gender by Weekday"). 

### Visualizations:

All analysis mentioned above can be found on the [Tableau Public storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/6JZWQJPQW?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) . 

## Summary

High user activity of the Citi Bike Share program is seen near popular tourist attractions in New York City during the month of August 2019. A majority of bike trips were in Manhattan Island, taken by male users during the morning and evening hours. A main reason for this could be that many New Yorkers are using the Citi Bike Program as an alternative to public transportation.

### Additional Suggestions
    - Comparing other months of the year would be very beneficial - high tourism vs. off season.
    - It would also be nice to see trends across different weather conditions - especially since Des Moines is considering the implementation of this program.
